Of course! Here's a revised short paragraph without mentioning the JSON library, and focusing only on the REST API client:




In this project, I developed a Java application called a REST API client to fetch and display weather information from a public API. The task involved retrieving real-time weather data such as temperature, humidity, and description. I used Eclipse IDE as my preferred platform to write and run the Java code. The program connects to the API, receives the data, and displays it in a readable format on the console.

This project helped me understand how REST APIs work and how to integrate live data into a Java application. Such tasks are useful in real-world applications like weather apps, travel tools, and live dashboards. Through this task, I learned how to build a working API client, manage the connection, and present the output clearly, which is valuable in many modern software development project.
